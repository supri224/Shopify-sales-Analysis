## Process
In this project, I imported and cleaned Shopify sales data using Power Query in Power BI. I created a structured data model by building relationships between relevant tables. Using DAX, I developed key measures to track revenue, order volume, and customer trends. Finally, I built an interactive dashboard with KPIs, charts, and slicers to deliver actionable insights.
